This project had me create a clock using Unity objects, and then write a script for them to behanve like a clock. 

Scripts use C#, which is a new language for me, but it definitely isn't unfamiliar because of Java experience

Overall, the project was a comprehensive intro to Unity, and a good refresher on oop
