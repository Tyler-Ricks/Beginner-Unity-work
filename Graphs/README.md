This project uses objects to generate boxes along a function, such as sin(x). It extends on stuff about objects, but also uses shaders to add additional visualization.

This was a good exercise on scripting objects because I definitely could have done it on my own. Also, it was a good intro to shaders, which I know will get more complicated later.

This project will probably be expanded on on my own. I often use Desmos to visualize different concepts, but now I can do that here too. I have a few ideas.
